          If you've ever been on a team where personality dynamics have hindered
          team performance, you understand how the right mix of personalities
          can be critical to successful outcomes. Your employer will use the
          results of this survey to build teams optimized for a specific
          performance goal. The aim is to create well balanced teams where
          individuals are valued for the unique roles they naturally play on a
          team.
